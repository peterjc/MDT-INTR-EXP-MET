<p>Thank you for coming today. This workshop is funded by the MDT in the framework of the project ‘Introducing experimental methods for the study of resource and land-related decisions in rural Scotland’. The experimental team consists of Simone Piras and Laure Kuhfuss from SEGS, and Peter Cock from ICS. We would like to show you how individual decision-making can be studied through experimental approaches. Please listen to the instructions carefully. These will be read aloud by the experimenter, and you will be given time for asking questions.</p>
<p>All the people in this session will play the same games as you. The games are computer-based, meaning that all interactions will take place via a computer network system. We will ask each of you to make different decisions. Your decisions as well as other participants’ decisions will be made in private, and they will not be revealed, even at the end of the session. Furthermore, all interactions are anonymous: you will never know the identity of the participants with whom you have interacted, and they will never know your identity. It is very important that you do not communicate with others during the game. If you do so, you will be excluded from the game.</p>
<p>The games you will play recreate simplified versions of situations you might face in everyday life. Just as the decisions you make in everyday life impact your earnings and wellbeing, each of the games will allow you to earn real money. And as in real life, the amount of money that you will earn depends on your decision, on chance, and, for the interactive game, on the decisions made by others too. There are no wrong of right decisions; therefore, we ask you to decide based exclusively on your preferences.</p>
<p>You will receive {{ session.config.participation_fee }} to thank you for your participation today. In addition to that, you will be paid a sum of money which depends on the results of the games. During the games we work in {{ units }}. At the end of the experiment, your earnings in {{ units }} will be converted into {{ rate }}. Your total earnings will be communicated to you privately at the end of the last game today. Other participants will not know your total earnings. You will be paid this money in your next payslip. Note that the money earned will be subject to taxation and national insurance.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions during the games, please do not open your microphone or talk to other participants; ask us by raising your hand virtually. A member of the experimental team will answer your question for everyone. Do you have any questions?</p>
